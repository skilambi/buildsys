# Build System

## Introduction
Build system (or buildsys for short) is a python package that performs the following operations:
1. Uses edalize under the hood to generate build scripts for RTL IP. It can generate this for simulation and vivado.
2. Generate code (C++, python and SV) for register read/writes (AXI-LITE) - (What this will end up being is TBD)
3. Should be used as a git submodule
